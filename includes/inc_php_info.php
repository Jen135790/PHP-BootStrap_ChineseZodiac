<h3>About PHP</h3>
<p>
    PHP, Hypertext Preprocessor, is an open source general-purpose scripting language that is used especially for web developemnt and is embedded into HTML.
    Unlike JavaScript, the scripted coded in PHP is executed on the server which generates HTML to be sent to the client. The client would see the results of the
    script but could not see the actual PHP script.<br/><br/>

    The special PHP script will always be enclosed in special start and end processing instructions. This allows coders to freely jump in and out of the PHP script.
    PHP script is able to run without any server or browser by using a PHP parser. It also allows coders to create desktop applications, though not the best and requires 
    the knowledge advanced PHP features, by using PHP-GTK.<br/><br/>

    PHP can be used on all major OS, operating systems, like Linus, Windows, and Mac OS. It's also supported by most modern web servers including Apache and IIS. 
    PHP allows the freedom of choosing an OS and web server. It also features support for databases. PHP can also support contacting other services using protocols such as
    LDAP, IMAP, SNMP, and so on. It has text processing features that includes the Perl compatible regular expressions and many extensions and tools to parse and access XML
     documents.
