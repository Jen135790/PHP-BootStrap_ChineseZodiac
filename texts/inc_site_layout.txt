<p>
A Web template is a tool used to separate content from presentation in Web 
design, and for mass-production of Web documents. It is a basic component of 
a Web template system.
</p><p>
Web templates can be used to set up any type of Web site. In its simplest 
sense, a Web template operates similarly to a form letter for use in setting 
up a Web site.
</p><p>
Content (from a database), and &ldquo;presentation specifications&rdquo; (in a 
Web template), are combined (through the template engine) to mass-produce Web 
documents.

<h4>Template Uses</h4>
<p>
Web templates can be used by any individual or organization to set up their 
Web site. Once a template is purchased or downloaded, the user will replace 
all generic information included in the Web template with their own personal, 
organizational or product information. Templates can be used to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Display personal information or daily activities as in a blog.</li>
<li>Sell products on-line.</li>
<li>Display information about a company or organization.</li>
<li>Display family history.</li>
<li>Display a gallery of photos.</li>
<li>Place music files such as mp3 on line for play through a Web browser.</li>
<li>Place videos on-line for public viewing.</li>
<li>To setup a private login area on-line.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Effective separation</h4>
<p>
A common goal among experienced Web developers is to develop and deploy 
applications that are flexible and easily maintainable. An important 
consideration in reaching this goal is the separation of business logic from 
presentation logic. Developers use Web template systems (with varying degrees 
of success) to maintain this separation.
</p><p>
One difficulty in evaluating this separation is the lack of well-defined 
formalisms to measure when and how well it is actually met. There are, however, 
fairly standard heuristics that have been borrowed from the domain of software 
engineering. These include &lsquo;inheritance&rsquo; (based on principles of 
object-oriented programming); and the &lsquo;Templating and Generative 
programming&rsquo;, (consistent with the principles of MVC separation). The 
precise difference between the various guidelines is subject to some debate, 
and some aspects of the different guidelines share a degree of similarity.

<h4>Flexible presentation</h4>
<p>
One major rationale behind &ldquo;effective separation&rdquo; is the need for 
maximum flexibility in the code and resources dedicated to the presentation 
logic. Client demands, changing customer preferences and desire to present a 
&ldquo;fresh face&rdquo; for pre-existing content often result in the need to 
dramatically modify the public appearance of Web content while disrupting the 
underlying infrastructure as little as possible.
</p><p>
The distinction between &ldquo;presentation&rdquo; (front end) and 
&ldquo;business logic&rdquo; (infrastructure) is usually an important one, 
because:
</p><ul>
<li>the presentation source code language may differ from other code 
     assets;</li>
<li>the production process for the application may require the work to be done 
     at separate times and locations;</li>
<li>different workers have different skill sets, and presentation skills do 
     not always coincide with skills for coding business logic;</li>
<li>code assets are easier to maintain and more readable when disparate 
     components are kept separate and loosely coupled;</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reusability</h4>
<p>
Not all potential users of Web templates have the willingness and ability to 
hire developers to design a system for their needs. Additionally, some may 
wish to use the Web but have limited or no technical proficiency. For these 
reasons, a number of developers and vendors have released Web templates 
specifically for reuse by non-technical people. Although Web template 
reusability is also important for even highly-skilled and technically 
experienced developers, it is especially critical to those who rely on 
simplicity and &ldquo;ready-made&rdquo; Web solutions.
</p><p>
Such &ldquo;ready-made&rdquo; Web templates are sometimes free, and easily 
made by an individual domestically. However, specialized Web templates are 
sometimes sold online. Although there are numerous commercial sites that offer 
Web templates for a licensing fee, there are also free and 
&ldquo;open-source&rdquo; sources as well.

<h4>Open source templates</h4>
<p>
The rise of the open source design movement has seen a slow but steady rise in 
the community of open source designers. Some sites offer open source templates 
in addition to other content.
